                            Before we talk about large tiles' size, style, and benefits, you might want to know what we
                            mean by large tiles. </p>
                        <p>

                            Maybe more than a decade ago, 12-inches tiles were considered large formats. However, due to
                            the advancement of technology and innovation in tile manufacturing, the definition of large
                            format tile has expanded to include tiles with at least one edge measuring 15 inches or
                            more.</p>
                        <p>

                            Large tiles come in different shapes, from square to rectangular, even in circles too, and
                            are made of porcelain, ceramic, and stone.</p>
                        <p>

                            Large porcelain tiles have a superior design and are available in a wide array of colours
                            and patterns, offering great versatility. Porcelain tiles are beautiful regardless of shapes
                            and sizes, yet large format porcelain tiles truly get everyone’s attention without fail.</p>
                        <p>

                            Furthermore, using these tiles results in fewer grout lines and makes your space more
                            aesthetically pleasing.</p>
                        <p>

                            Large format porcelain tiles are the ideal choice for residences, buildings, and commercial
                            areas because of their versatile design options and benefits, which we will discuss further
                            in this article. But before that, let’s see when and where to use large porcelain tiles.

                                    expands your space and creates a cohesive look. These tiles have patterns remarkably

                                <p>
                                    Large format tiles come in different sizes, designs, patterns, and colours. But the
                                    question is, “Does size matter?”</p>
                                <p>

                                    While purchasing tiles, many people ignore the size and end up purchasing smaller
                                    porcelain slabs instead.</p>
                                <p>

                                    Tile size affects design primarily because of grout lines. By tiling large format
                                    tiles, fewer tiles are required, which means fewer grout lines. These tiles create a
                                    more minimalist feel, regardless of the size of the room. Whereas smaller tiles have
                                    a completely different effect.</p>
                                <p>

                                    Large format porcelain tiles often have a 6mm or more thickness than regular
                                    porcelain tiles. The size of large slabs for floors or walls that exceed 12” x 12”.
                                    There is no doubt that this highly durable material is considerably lighter and less
                                    expensive than other slabs and tile.
