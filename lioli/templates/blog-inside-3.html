                                    Porcelain tiles are a very hard type of ceramic tile. It is made up of refined clay with natural elements, kiln-fired at high temperatures making it more durable, long-lasting and resistant to stain, scratch, and water. Porcelain tiles are best for bathroom or kitchen floors or walls because it is a denser and harder option with great stain and water resistance. Lioli Ceramica is the largest manufacturer of porcelain tile slabs offering premium slabs to decorate your spaces.

                                    The formation of natural stone takes thousands of years and is overlooked because it has been around for such a long time. This makes stone durable and hard-wearing. It has been used for residential and commercial projects for years. If you need to use where the amount of traffic is high then you need a thicker slab to withstand the weight of vehicles and for this granite stone is the best. Granite stone is available in 25mm thicker and suitable for exterior and provides strength and durability.

                                    Porcelain tile is a mixture of clay, sand and minerals baked at high temperature which makes it denser, less porous and extremely tough with each slab calibrated to 20mm of thickness. It means it is suitable to take the weight of vehicles and withstand extreme temperature and weather conditions without being damaged or getting hot underneath!

                                    Natural stone tiles require lots of maintenance and it depends on the types of stone you choose. The finish of natural stone impacts maintenance and determines cleaning techniques. It's generally a good idea to seal to prevent any staining and the growth of any moss or algae.

                                    Porcelain tiles require very little maintenance and their glazed surface means it doesn't need to be sealed. As porcelain tiles are impervious tiles that means anything that is likely to leave a stain won’t penetrate into the stone.

                                    There is nothing wrong with asking the question “Which is best?” Or “Why porcelain tiles are better than natural stone?“
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From the overall article, you got to know that porcelain tiles are stronger than natural stone. Porcelain tiles are not only denser in nature but also withstand higher temperatures and prevent staining or scratching.

                                    Porcelain is the best choice for home decor with a range of varieties, a long-lasting and water-resistant surface and needs very little maintenance. On the other hand, natural stone offers unique and eye-catching finishes but needs regular sealing and treatment although it is easy and quick to do and needs to be done once every 2-3 years.
