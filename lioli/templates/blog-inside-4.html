                                    Porcelain tiles are made of refined clay, with ultrafine sand and feldspar added to the mixture. After being kiln-fired at high temperatures and transformed, they look like stone, wood, concrete or materials. This clay-based construction makes porcelain tiles a subtype of ceramic tiles. However, porcelain tile is harder to construct, durable and long-lasting than non-porcelain ceramic tiles. Lioli Ceramica porcelain tiles company in India, we manufacture and source of high technology offers several options: porcelain floor tiles, porcelain slabs, and countertop porcelain tiles.

                                    Ceramic tiles are made with specific clay (with red, brown and white clay) and kiln-fired at a higher temperature but lower than porcelain tiles to reduce water level content, making them less dense, softer and more porous. The clay used in it is less refined hence it is less durable than porcelain tile. Ceramic tile is more affordable with numerous design options.

                                    Porcelain tiles are well crafted, denser and less porous than ceramic tiles. It is categorised as impervious tiles which means the water absorption rate is less than 0.5 % making them perfect for bathrooms and other damp areas. A low water absorption rate enables a tile to absorb the stain of food and beverages in a lesser percentage.

                                    Since porcelain tile has a highly dense material, it is much harder and can withstand heavy use over time than ceramic tile. Porcelain tile is more durable and less prone to wear. Which makes it ideal for both home and commercial use.

                                    Porcelain tiles are unglazed and have the same colour underneath while ceramic tiles often have a glazed surface and reveal different colours underneath.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Porcelain tiles' water absorption level is less than 0.5 % whereas ceramic tiles’ water absorption level is more than 0.5%.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Porcelain tiles are denser and harder compared to ceramic tiles, which are less dense and softer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Porcelain tiles are more brittle and available in many designs, whereas ceramic tiles can be prone to cracking in cold weather and are available in more up-to-date designs.

                                    Porcelain tiles are dense and hard in nature, so it is difficult to cut. Ceramic tiles are less dense and soft in nature and easy to cut.

                                    From the above article, you got to know the difference between porcelain tiles vs. ceramic tiles and the pros and cons of each.

                                <p>
                                    Porcelain tile is expensive but it is a harder substance that prevents cracking and is highly durable. While ceramic tile is cheaper, it is less dense and may crack in cold weather.

                                <p>
                                    The higher water resistance of porcelain tiles makes them an option to use both indoors and outdoors. However, ceramic tiles tend to have a softer surface to make them suitable inside the home in warm climates.
