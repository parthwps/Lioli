                                    Non-slippery vinyl flooring
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    ts durability and budget-friendly nature make vinyl flooring a top choice for many homeowners. The main advantage of vinyl tiles is that they can resist moisture and withstand heavy traffic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Vinyl flooring is available in various sizes. Either you can go for LVT (Luxury Vinyl Tiles) or LVP (Luxury Vinyl Planks).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Moreover, vinyl flooring is easy to install and maintain.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can customize your vinyl flooring to look like wood flooring, ceramic, or any other kind of floor according to your decor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Vinyl flooring is also available in waterproof varieties. As we know not a single floor is 100% slip-resistant. But vinyl tiles have in-built padding which minimizes the shock to your body whenever you fall.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The major disadvantage of vinyl flooring is that it is not eco-friendly. They are made up of non-renewable chemicals which emit VOC (volatile organic compounds) which can be harmful to humans.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you are opting for vinyl flooring, then make sure that the product is certified with FloorScore. It depicts that the product emits less VOC and can be used as your anti-slip flooring option.

                                    Cork or bamboo flooring
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Cork or bamboo flooring is one of the best options for your anti-slip bathroom flooring. If you want to keep your bathroom natural thermal insulation and cut down on sound travel then you should go for cork or bamboo flooring.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Both of them are made up of renewable sources. For bamboo flooring, stalks of bamboo (grass) are split and reformed into planks. While cork is made up of scraps from bottle stopper production.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Both can give an aesthetic view of your bathroom, and make it look more trendy and modern.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Their water-absorbing feature makes it different. However, this feature can be a blessing or a bane.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Blessing in a way due to its water-absorbing property there are fewer chances of tripping on the wet floor, and in the case of cork, it has a spongy surface which minimizes the chance of footing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But for bamboo, water-absorbing features can cause a bit of havoc. If not dried properly they can cause the growth of mildew and moulds. For cork, they are water-resistant but can cause water damage when immersed in water for a longer time. So mostly waterproof sealant after installation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To avoid this make sure your bathroom has enough ventilation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Both of them are durable, low-maintenance, and cost-effective. They also come in a variety of designs and colours.

                                <p>
                                    Linoleum a.k.a Lino flooring has been one of the favourite choices of homeowners for a long time. Linoleum is often confused with vinyl flooring. They both have a key difference.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Linoleum is more eco-friendly as compared to vinyl flooring. It is made up of linseed oil, jute, powdered cork, and ground limestone. At the end of their life-cycle either it can be recycled or left on the compost heap.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Linoleum is very durable, with proper maintenance it can last for 40 years. It is water-resistant. Its slippery surface can be diminished by adding non-slip resistant film, which makes it the best option for non-slip floor tiles for wet rooms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Linoleum flooring has diverse options to choose from varied colours and design options and is easy to maintain.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But they are even more expensive than vinyl flooring, and you require professional help for installation which can charge you extra money.
                                </p>

                                    Moreover, it loses its original colour or turns yellow as it ages or is exposed directly to sunlight. Which is not even removed by cleaning.

                                    Rubber flooring is not that often used, but the reason they are on this list is they are the most reliable slip-resistance flooring. But now, people are considering rubber flooring for their bathrooms.

                                <p>
                                    Like cork, bamboo, and linoleum, rubber is also made up of natural components which make it environment-friendly. But make sure to check the environment credentials before buying, it suggests whether the product is reliable or not.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Rubber flooring is recommended as it is tough and feels soft under the foot. The speciality of rubber is that it doesn’t become slick even when it is wet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Extra cushions in rubber flooring protect your body from injury and reduce shock when you fall. If you are thinking of rubber flooring go for a textured surface as it provides more grip even when the surface is wet.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    But there are a few drawbacks you should be aware of before choosing natural stones as your bathroom flooring.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They are expensive. Natural stones are heavy and hard to cut and require professional help to install. This will add to your expenses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But it is a one-time investment. If you are not short on money then, natural stones might be the best choice for your bathroom flooring. As they are not only slip-resistant they will also give your bathroom a positive look.
