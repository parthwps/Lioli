                                    Using advanced technology in the manufacturing process can make large format
                                    porcelain tiles rugged and durable. The composition makes the body denser than other
                                    tiles because they are stamped or pressed before firing.

                                    So this makes them quite durable and available in larger sizes. Despite the higher
                                    density and large scale, porcelain tiles are much lighter in weight compared to
                                    other types of tiles.

                                    porcelain format. Recently, the most prominent interior design trend has shifted to
                                    clean and contemporary design.

                                    The reason to consider large porcelain tiles is that they often come with great
                                    beauty and uniqueness and keep the space simple and uncluttered with a minimalistic
                                    touch.

                                    Another advantage of large format porcelain tiles is that they are easier to install
                                    compared to smaller tiles. A large floor area can be covered with a smaller number
                                    of sheets. Innovative installation methods and advanced tooling allow quick, easy,
                                    and simple tilling.
