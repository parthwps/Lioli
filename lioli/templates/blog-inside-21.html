                            installation. So follow the instructions and tips below to ensure the beauty of your wall
                            tiles for years to come.

                        </p>

                            01. Surface Preparation




                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Whether it's floor or walls, to fit the tile perfectly, you require a flat surface. The wall
                            surface you are tiling on should be appropriately prepared before laying the large format
                            porcelain tile. It should be clean, suitably level, dry, and dust-free.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You won't be able to lay off extra large tiles on walls if your surface isn't flat enough or
                            has deflection.


                        </p>

                            So, how to create a flat wall surface?

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Before tiling or levelling, the surface should be treated to reduce the porosity or minimise
                            chemical reactions with cement-based adhesive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plastering walls is one of the best ways to ensure a flat surface. Despite its simplicity,
                            plastering a wall can be challenging at first. We recommend getting professional help, or
                            you can watch youtube tutorials to learn.

                        <p>
                            Large format porcelain tiles available in varied sizes, colours, designs and patterns can be
                            used anywhere. Since large-format wall tiles are heavier and harder than standard wall
                            tiles, a proper layout plan is required for your “forever home tiles.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Take your time creating the right layout plan. Start from the centre and draw your layout

                            Handling the large format tile requires two people. We recommend using a powerful suction

                            The adhesive application on the back side of large format tiles must have the same parallel
                            direction of the adhesive on the wall.

                        <p>
                            Even having a perfectly flat surface, lippage is still a concern for large-format porcelain
                            wall tile installation. Lippage occurs when the adjacent edges of two tiles are not the same
                            level (which means one tile edge is higher or lower than the other tile). The tile spacer is
                            recommended to prevent lippage in large-size tiles.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another tool to prevent lippage is a levelling system, which professionals mostly use and
                            recommend. These systems are easy-to-use and help in creating a lippage-free installation.

                            For large-format porcelain tile installation, most professional tile installers recommend
                            sanded grout.

                            Grouting might seem simple and easy, but it’s quite a messy process. So after grouting,
                            cleaning is so difficult.

                            Don’t forget to remove extra grout and let them dry for a couple of days. After the grout
                            becomes harder and cures, apply the sealing (if it's mentioned in the grout package).

                            As you know, different types of porcelain tiles are available in the market. Most porcelain
                            tiles don’t require sealing, therefore, require no effort to maintain a sleek appearance,
                            but if you’re using polished porcelain, you might require sealing.

                            Tiling on uneven wall surfaces can result in disaster. An unlevel wall surface can prevent
                            the adhesive from sticking, and placing heavy and large tiles cause your entire wall
                            installation to collapse.

                            The trowel size must match the size of the tiles. Using the wrong trowel size can collapse
                            the tiles from the wall substrate. For large format tiles, you need the adhesive to be

                            Using tile-cutting tools, take some precautions not to break or crack tiles. Large-format
                            porcelain tiles are heavy and hard compared to standard ceramic tiles.

                        <p>
                            Make sure you measure the tile and mark it with the wax pencil before cutting the tiles.
                            Don’t rush the process of cutting tiles; the harder and larger the material you are cutting,
                            the slower you need to be.

                                If you plan to create unique wall patterns, buy 20-30% more tiles.

                                Tiling walls can be messy, so it is wise to protect the floor by covering them with
                                large paper or securing it with a painter’s tap.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once you finish grouting the tiles, don't let the excess grout dry because It will be
                                harder to scrape off once it dries up.
                            </li>
