                            We all want to give our home a heartwarming look that eases out all our tension and gives a
                            sense of relief. When choosing the decor for our office space, we want a look that gives
                            energising vibes and inspires us to work hard.

                        <p>
                            But, here comes the task when you choose tiles for your home. Usually, people look for a
                            budget-friendly and durable option that abodes beauty and charm to our space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plus, thousands of tiles are available with eye-catching designs, patterns and magnificent
                            colours that make selecting the perfect tile for your home quite overwhelming.

                            In this tile-buying journey, the first and foremost question you come across is whether to
                            choose branded tiles or local tiles.

                            This blog discusses certain points that will give you a clear picture of why branded tiles
                            are better than local tiles.

                            Difference Between Branded Tiles And Local Tiles

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            You are mistaken if you think that branded and local tiles are almost similar. Both these
                            tiles differ in quality, quantity, and even durability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People often get blinded by the price tag, buy the product with a lower price and then face
                            the consequences; it is a completely wrong thing and should be avoided at any cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are some basic differences between branded and local tiles, and let’s see who wins the
                            battle.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the main differences between branded and local tiles is their availability. So,
                            imagine you are renovating your living room, but unfortunately, you run out of stock for the
                            tiles. In this situation, you will try to contact the dealer, right?

                        </p>
                        <ul class="ml-4">
                            <li>
                                In the case of local tiles, there are slight chances that you will get the same tiles.
                                There is a high chance that the dealer would have run out of stock.

                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Another thing here is local tile manufacturers available in some regions of the country,
                                narrowing your chances of getting the same tiles.

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            While with branded tiles, you will never come across this kind of situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many tile companies have outlets in the local and international markets, so you can get the
                            same tile within some hours delivered to your doorsteps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At last, in the case of availability, branded tiles win over local tiles.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Did you receive your packages of tiles? Did you check for inconsistencies in designs,
                            thickness, patterns, sizes, colours, and quality in tiles from the same pack?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a common scenario if you buy tiles from local manufacturers. It’s not a time thing,
                            but you have to face this sometimes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result of poor quality control, local tiles are often inconsistent and have minor flaws
                            in their products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, the branded tiles are made up of the latest technology, with a strict
                            manufacturing process and stringent quality measures to follow and make the best quality
                            tiles for your space.

                            While branded tiles can enhance your room’s beauty for more than a decade or two, local
                            tiles can last long for 13-15 years. But sometimes they fade earlier than their original
                            date and require a replacement.

                            Have you ever faced a situation when there are two different prices for the same tiles? It
                            generally happens when you buy tiles from local tile dealers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Local tiles are cheaper than branded tiles, per their distribution network. So you can find
                            different prices for tiles at different locations.

                            While branded tiles follow one price rule pan-India, so you find the same pricing of tiles
                            in every state of the country.
