                            It's Christmas time, which means get-togethers with family and friends. However, merriment

                        <p>
                            Knowing how to remove stains is important to keep your tile sparkling. You might have no
                            trouble cleaning lemonade stains, but red wine stains might be more challenging.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, if you have installed porcelain tiles, you are on the safe side, as porcelain tiles are
                            nonporous. But leaving the stain as it is for a long time can leave a mark behind them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As per the experts, a clean cloth soaked in hydrogen peroxide is enough for the tough stain
                            and can make your tiles new. Or cleaning with vinegar and water can also do magic. If you
                            want a simpler option, you can buy porcelain stain cleaners for cleaning; you just have to
                            follow the instructions given carefully.
