                            We overlook many factors while looking for a perfect tile for our workspace. Since offices
                            receive higher foot traffic than our homes, looking for a resilient and practical option
                            with a great wall and floor tile design is necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, consider the following factors before choosing the best office tiles for your workspace.

                                    One of the most important aspects to consider while selecting the best floor tiles
                                    for the office. Lower-grade floor tiles can crack and look shabby and cost you more
                                    than their initial costs.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Moreover, office tiles come under commercial-grade flooring, which is more durable
                                    and sturdy than the tiles we use at home.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Every room in your workspace receives different footfalls; for example, the
                                    reception area and corridor receive the most visitors, while the conference or
                                    meeting room receives the lowest.

                                </p>

                                            Consider heavy-duty tiles like porcelain, vinyl, polished concrete, and
                                            granite in high-traffic areas.

                                            Whereas a luxury carpet, softwood flooring is best for conference or meeting
                                            rooms.

                                    Installing floors is not enough. You require regular maintenance to make your office
                                    tiles look fresh and new.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Stained, chipped tiles or visible scratches on the floors would create a bad first
                                    impression on clients. And sometimes maintenance costs are higher than installing
                                    costs.
                                </p>

                                    The office has more foot traffic, so floors need extra attention to prevent chipping
                                    and wear and tear. So be critical while choosing material for office floor tiles.

                                            Note that light colours stain quickly as compared to dark colours. Choose
                                            neutral-coloured tile for the office.

                                            Just a regular cleaning can make your tiles breathe longer.

                                    Before jumping to any further conclusions, consider the life-cycle cost of each
                                    option, not just the initial cost. After buying a cheap product, we tend to pay
                                    double its price to maintain it.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Creating aesthetics is good, but going over budget is not a good financial decision.
                                    It's a workspace you don’t want to make your staff lose their concentration.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It would be best if you have durable and functional tiles with appealing looks.

                                    Consider office tile flooring, which lasts long, can withstand high traffic and is
                                    easy to maintain at an affordable cost. Or you can talk to an expert to choose the

                                    Along with the elegant look, tiles also need to be functional. One of the most

                                    For example, your kitchen and washroom areas are prone to liquid spills, or
                                    high-traffic areas such as corridors and reception may also require slip-resistant
                                    tile flooring.

                                    Workers do not want to look at bare floors that feel hard or cold underfoot.
                                    Employees want a comfortable and inspiring environment to work, discuss new ideas,
                                    and be creative while crafting business strategies.

                                    what size would be the best? In our opinion, large format tiles are the best for
                                    commercial space. Why? Here are the reasons.

                                            Large-format tiles will allow seamless uniformity. Installing large tiles
                                            means fewer tiles to be installed, resulting in fewer groupings. These
                                            create visual continuity and a stylish look.

                                    From numerous options, you can either choose the same flooring for the entire office
                                    to create uniformity or choose different ideas for different office room floor tiles
                                    according to their different ambience. </p>
                                <p>

                                    Whatever office flooring you choose, ensure it fits all the above factors. So,
                                    consider asking manufacturers or an expert for advice while taking a big step.
