                            surfing on the net or turning pages of brochures, let me introduce two famous finishes:
                            Glossy and Matte finish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Glossy and matte finish tiles are the most popular among homeowners, architects, and
                            builders. Both finishes come in various designs, patterns, and colours to accentuate the

                            Even though both glossy and matte finish porcelain tiles undergo the same manufacturing
                            procedure, they differ a lot.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Glossy finish tiles have an extra but durable glaze layer of liquid glass. It makes
                            porcelain tiles shinier and brighter with an ultra-smooth texture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The liquid glass layer enhances the tiles' patterns and colours, giving the space a
                            luxurious look for decades (No Worry! The sheen won't fade away).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The glossy finish tiles can accentuate home decor by giving it a classy, trendy, and stylish
                            look.

                        <p>
                            Now, let’s see some benefits of glossy finish tiles.

                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            01. Easy To Clean

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The first benefit of glossy tiles is they are <a href='{{url_for("blog.blog_inside5")}}'>
                                easy to maintain</a> The glazed layer on the
                            porcelain tiles makes them smoother and less porous.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, the stains remaining on the surface can easily be cleaned with a damp cloth. A simple
                            swipe, and voila! The space will shine.

                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned above, glossy tiles have a shinier surface, creating a mirror effect in the
                            room.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Glossy tiles reflect the light in the room. This phenomenon tricks the eyes into believing
                            that the room is much bigger than it appears.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, this illusion helps to make a smaller room appear bigger. This property of glossy
                            tiles makes them a perfect fit to use in small spaces or where there is significantly less
                            natural light.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is one of the most significant benefits of glossy tiles.

                        <p>
                            To make the space more beautiful and elegant, then gloss finish porcelain tiles are the
                            to-go option.

                        <p>
                            After the benefits, let’s see some of the drawbacks of glossy finish tiles.

                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            01. Highlights Imperfections

                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            The most significant benefit can turn into the biggest drawback too. The higher reflection
                            rate of the tiles makes the tiniest smudges and stains appear definitively. Due to this, you
                            need to clean the surfaces frequently.

                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            02. Slippery Surface

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Another drawback of glossy tiles is they are slippery. The less-absorption rate makes the
                            surface more slippery.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The extra glaze layer, water puddle, and haste can make you reach the hospital. But it's
                            safer to use them on walls.

                        </p>


                        <h4>
                            03. Shine Can Be Distracting

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The shinier surface is not everyone's cup of tea. It may be playful for toddlers, but not
                            for adults.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moreover, while focusing on a particular task, you don't want any distractions to meddle
                            with your work, which shiny surfaces always do.

                    <p>
                        Due to ease of maintenance, glossy tiles are apt for stain-prone areas like kitchens,
                        backsplashes, fireplaces, and sometimes even countertops or bathroom walls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their lustrous look makes them perfect for walls and floors. For instance, glossy finish wall
                        tiles are trending as they add an extra dimension to the room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can turn your dull guest room into a luxurious suit with glossy finish porcelain wall and
                        floor tiles or add more glitz to your master bedroom with these tiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glossy finish floor and wall tiles are perfect for small congested areas like hallways and
                        corridors to make the space look bigger.

                    <p>
                        The most significant difference between matte and glossy tiles is their appearance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike glossy finish tiles, matte tiles do not have any shiny appearance. Instead, they are dull
                        and have a rough surface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A special layer is added on the top of the tile to achieve a non-shiny look. If you want a
                        subtle and natural look for your space, then matte-finish porcelain tiles are your go-to option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matte finish tiles amplify the aesthetics of the room. The matte surface highlights the room's
                        accessories, giving the space rich and elegant vibes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matte tiles are in trend now. Many people, especially the younger generation opt for them
                        because of their aesthetic appeal and evergreen looks.

                    <p>
                        Here are some reasons why matte finish tiles are the best choice for your home.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        01. Anti-Slippery Properties

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The biggest benefit of matte finish tiles- it has a rough surface. The presence of a rough
                        surface increases the friction between the foot and the tiles. As a result, you can have a
                        comfortable walk, without fear of slipping.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The anti-slip property of matte-finish tiles makes them ideal for the outdoors like patios,
                        gardens, around the swimming pools, or compound areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here, take note that not a single tile is 100% slip-resistant or carries a slip-proof guarantee.
                        Instead, slip-resistant tiles lower the chances of accidents. Slips can still occur, if there is
                        dirt, objects laying on the floor carelessly, or if there is water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But yes, they lower the chances of accidents. Slip accidents may occur due to dirt or objects
                        lying on the floor; it's not always water.

                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        02. Low-Maintenance

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Another major benefit of matte finish tiles is their rough surface can easily conceal stains (of
                        any kind) and scratches better than glossy tiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, you don’t have to be a clean freak when there is even a smaller spill. This property makes
                        matte finish floor tiles ideal for use in high-traffic areas.

                    </p>

                        03. Gives A Rustic Look

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Are you a fan of a rustic look, warm and natural earthy tones? If yes, then matte finish tiles
                        are for you. Matte finish porcelain tiles come in different effects, such as wood, stones, and
                        cement, to give a rustic touch to the interior.

                        01. Stubborn Stains

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Due to their rough surface matte finish tiles easily camouflage stains and scratches. But, if
                        there is any spill, the liquid will stick to the uneven surface, and it would be hard to remove
                        them.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Compared to glossy tiles, where you need a simple wipe to clean the stain, in matte finish
                        tiles, you need to make an extra effort to clean the stain.

                        02. Not Suitable For Smaller Rooms

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Unlike gloss tiles, matt finish tiles have a rougher surface; thus, they do not reflect light
                        that effectively. Contrary to the glossy finish, matte finish tiles make the space look smaller
                        and more cluttered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, matte finish tiles can be used only in large rooms with enough availability of
                        natural light

                    </p>

                        Where To Use Matte Finish Porcelain Tiles?

                    <p>
                        Matte finish tiles are suitable for use both inside and outside because of their anti-slip
                        properties.

                        Which Is Better: Glossy Or Matte Finish Tiles?

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In the above blog, we have discussed the two most popular porcelain tile finishes- gloss and
                        matte.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It depends on the homeowner or architect and which tile they want for their project. There are
                        no strict guidelines or written laws which you have to obey while selecting a tile finish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is advised to see the pros and cons of the tile before you make the final decision. For
                        instance, if you are renovating your study room, glossy tiles can be distracting and make you
                        lose focus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While if you have a studio apartment, then installing matte tiles can make the place look more
                        cluttered, here you need to install glossy tiles.

                        Matte And Glossy Tiles For A Perfect Mix-And-Match Effect

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        If you still need clarification about which one to choose, glossy or matte porcelain tiles,
                        choose both. Glossy and matte tiles are the perfect fit to create a mix-and-match or fusion
                        effect. Matte floor tiles and glossy wall tiles overall will create a classy and modern look.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not fond of fusion art? We recommend you use each finish in one room. For example, make your
                        ordinary bedroom extraordinary by installing glossy finish porcelain tiles giving it a luxurious
                        touch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider installing matte finish porcelain tiles to create a calm and welcoming environment for
                        guests.
