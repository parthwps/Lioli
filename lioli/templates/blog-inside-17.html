                            As you know, porcelain is a type of ceramic with much better durability. Even though they
                            look the same and are made from clay and kiln-fired, a few key differences set them apart.

                        <p>
                            Homeowners, contractors, and interior designers prefer <a
                                href="{{url_for('blog.blog_inside4')}}"> porcelain tiles over ceramic tiles</a> because
                            of their amazing features. Porcelain floor tiles are more durable, strong, and have more
                            resistance capability. In contrast, ceramic tiles are less durable and prone to crack in
                            cold weather, and having a water absorption level is more than 0.5% means less resistance
                            capability.

                        <p>

                                Gloss tiles make the smallest room look bigger and feel lighter and brighter.

                        <p>
                            The light reflection plays a trick on your eyes to make the room appear bigger and wider
                            than the actual one. The smaller amount of light bounces on glossy tiles back and forth in
                            the space, making it look brighter. As a result, these tiles are excellent options for
                            box-size rooms and hallways which are smaller and narrow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bonus point! It's extremely easy to clean; the smooth surface of gloss tiles needs a simple
                            wipe down with a mop and luke water to sparkle. This is one of the reasons why a glossy tile
                            is a great option for kitchen backsplashes and shower walls.
